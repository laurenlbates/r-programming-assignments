What is R Markdown?

R Markdown allows us to combine text (such as this) and code chucks to create reports, presenations, and more.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$mpg)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_point(aes(color=wt))
```
```{r LaTeX math expression}
plot(1:10, main = expression(alpha + beta + gamma))
```
